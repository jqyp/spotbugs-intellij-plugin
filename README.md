IntelliJ SpotBugs plugin provides static byte code analysis to look for bugs in Java code from within IntelliJ IDEA.
The plugin uses [SpotBugs](https://spotbugs.github.io/) under the hood.

The plugin is created by [Andrey Cherkasov](mailto:jqy@protonmail.com) and sponsored by JetBrains s.r.o.

The plugin is based on [FindBugs-IDEA](https://github.com/andrepdo/findbugs-idea), which is created by [Andre Pfeiler](mailto:andrepdo@dev.java.net) and licensed under the [GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.1.en.html).

Contribution from [Stanislav Anokhin](mailto:staslock@gmail.com) (migration to gradle build system) is used.

[SpotBugs](https://spotbugs.github.io/) is the spiritual successor of [FindBugs](https://github.com/findbugsproject/findbugs), carrying on from the point where it left off with support of its community.
